# TODO <2025-05-05>
- Which API service?
- How to configure? Something like a .YAML file, where the user manually edits the file (timezones, city, etc.) or a setup script that guides and prompts the user? Considering both.
- Where to deploy/store? Considering `/bin`, but that may require root privileges.
