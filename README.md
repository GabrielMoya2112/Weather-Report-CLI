Weather Report: a minimalist shell script that fetches and displays your local weather on the terminal.
Inspired by the Jazz-Fusion band of the same name.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Pulls real-time weather from open, free APIs (wttr.in, Open-Meteo, etc.)
- Terminal-first, clean output, lightweight, hackable.
- MOTD integration (for login displays)

## ðŸš€ Usage
```bash
bash weather-report.sh

```
## TODO
- Which API service?
- How to configure? .yaml files where the user manually edits, or a setup script that guides and prompts user? Maybe both.
- Where is it stored? /bin? Do I need root permissions for this?
